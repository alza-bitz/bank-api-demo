We will work together to implement the solution end-to-end by feature "slice":
 
- First slice: create account, view account
- Second slice: deposit, view account events (audit log)
- Third slice: withdraw, transfer

For each slice, we will implement DDD layers in turn:

1. Domain layer and persistence layer
2. Application layer
3. Interface layer

So we are iterating at two levels, the outer level by feature slice and the inner level by DDD layers.

In each feature/layer combination, we will work together to implement the code and tests needed, and I will provide feedback on any code you generate before we move on to the next layer or feature.
